## Introduction
Non-sinusoidal oscillators are electronic circuits that generate waveforms other than sine waves, such as square, triangular, or sawtooth waves. Unlike sinusoidal oscillators, which produce smooth and continuous waveforms, non-sinusoidal oscillators produce sharp transitions and are typically used in digital electronics, timing circuits, and waveform generators.

These oscillators often rely on nonlinear components like transistors or operational amplifiers combined with resistors and capacitors. Common types include:

Square wave oscillators (used in clocks and switching circuits)

Triangular wave oscillators (used in waveform generation and modulation)

Sawtooth wave oscillators (common in sweep generators and audio synthesis)

Their applications span signal processing, digital systems, and communication, where precise timing or specific waveform shapes are required.

### About the Experiment 
Non-sinusoidal oscillators are circuits that produce periodic waveforms with sharp transitions, such as square, triangular, or sawtooth waves, instead of smooth sine waves. These waveforms are generated using nonlinear electronic components and are commonly used in digital systems, signal generators, and timing applications. They are essential in applications where fast switching or specific waveform shapes are needed.
